# GM FRENS DAPP
This dapp enables users with a verified passport containing certain verified stamps to send a message with the @orbisclub/orbis-sdk.

Current implementation of the passport-sdk-scorer looks for a valid ENS, Github, Google, POAP, or Twitter Stamp. This can easily be changed with custom scores for each stamp.
